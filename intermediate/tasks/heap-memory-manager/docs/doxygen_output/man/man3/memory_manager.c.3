.PP
Initializes the memory manager\&. This function initializes the memory manager\&. It sets up necessary configurations and parameters for memory management operations within the program\&. It specifically determines the system page size using the \fCgetpagesize()\fP system call and assigns it to the global variable \fCSYSTEM_PAGE_SIZE\fP\&.
.PP
\fBNote\fP
.RS 4
This function should be called before any memory management operations are performed within the program\&. It is typically called at the beginning of the program execution to ensure proper initialization of memory management functionalities\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBWarning\fP
.RS 4
This function relies on the \fCgetpagesize()\fP system call to determine the system page size\&. Therefore, it may not be portable across all platforms\&. It is primarily intended for use in Unix-like systems where \fCgetpagesize()\fP is available\&.

.SS "void mm_instantiate_new_page_family (char * struct_name, uint32_t struct_size)"

.PP
Instantiates a new page family for a memory structure\&. This function creates a new page family for a memory structure identified by its name and size\&. It allocates memory for the page family and adds it to the existing virtual memory pages if necessary\&. Each page family can contain multiple memory structures of the same type\&.
.PP
\fBParameters\fP
.RS 4
\fIstruct_name\fP The name of the memory structure\&. 
.br
\fIstruct_size\fP The size of the memory structure\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBNote\fP
.RS 4
If the size of the memory structure exceeds the system page size, an error message is printed, and the function returns without creating the page family\&.
.PP
This function maintains a linked list of virtual memory pages (\fCfirst_vm_page_for_families\fP) to store the page families\&. If there are no existing pages, it allocates a new page and initializes it with the first page family\&. If the existing pages are full, it allocates a new page and adds it to the beginning of the linked list\&.
.PP
If a page family with the same name already exists, an assertion error is triggered, indicating a conflict in page family instantiation\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBWarning\fP
.RS 4
This function relies on the \fC\fBmm_get_new_vm_page_from_kernel()\fP\fP function to allocate memory from the kernel for the page family\&. Improper use or misuse of this function can lead to memory leaks or system instability\&.

Checks if a virtual memory page is empty\&. This function determines whether a virtual memory page is empty based on its metadata\&.
.PP
\fBParameters\fP
.RS 4
\fIvm_page\fP Pointer to the virtual memory page to be checked\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBReturns\fP

.PP
.RE
.PP
\fBNote\fP
.RS 4
A virtual memory page is considered empty if all the following conditions are met:
.IP "\(bu" 2
The 'next_block' pointer in the block metadata is NULL, indicating no next block\&.
.IP "\(bu" 2
The 'prev_block' pointer in the block metadata is NULL, indicating no previous block\&.
.IP "\(bu" 2
The 'is_free' flag in the block metadata is set to MM_TRUE, indicating the page is free\&.
.PP
.RE
.PP
\fBWarning\fP
.RS 4
It is important to ensure that the 'vm_page' parameter is a valid pointer to a virtual memory page structure\&. Passing invalid or uninitialized pointers may result in undefined behavior\&.

.PP
\fBNote\fP
.RS 4
This function should be invoked after the application has performed registration for all its structures using the \fCMM_REG_STRUCT\fP macro\&. It relies on the \fCfirst_vm_page_for_families\fP global variable, which maintains a linked list of virtual memory pages containing page families\&.

.SS "void* xcalloc (char * struct_name, int units)"

.PP
Allocates and initializes memory for an array of structures\&. This function allocates memory for an array of structures of the specified type and initializes the memory to zero\&. It first looks up the page family associated with the specified structure name to determine the size of the structure\&. Then, it checks if the requested memory size exceeds the maximum allocatable memory per page\&. If the allocation is successful, it initializes the allocated memory to zero and returns a pointer to the allocated memory\&.
.PP
\fBParameters\fP

.SS "void xfree (void * app_data)"

.PP
Frees memory allocated by the memory manager\&. This function is used to free memory that was previously allocated by the memory manager\&. It takes a pointer to the memory to be freed as its argument\&. The pointer is adjusted to point to the block metadata, and then it is passed to the memory manager's free blocks function\&.

.PP
Pointer to the first virtual memory page for page families\&. This static pointer variable holds the address of the first virtual memory page used to store page families\&. It is initialized to NULL, indicating that no virtual memory page is currently allocated for page families\&. As page families are instantiated, new virtual memory pages may be allocated and linked to this pointer\&.
.PP
