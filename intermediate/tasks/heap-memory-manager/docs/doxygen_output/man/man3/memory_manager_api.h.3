.SS "#define MM_REG_STRUCT(struct_name)     (\fBmm_instantiate_new_page_family\fP(#struct_name, sizeof(struct_name)))"

.PP
Registers a memory structure for page family instantiation\&. This macro facilitates the registration of a memory structure for page family instantiation within the memory manager\&. It takes the name of the structure (\fCstruct_name\fP) as a parameter and uses the \fC#\fP operator to stringify it, which is then passed to the \fC\fBmm_instantiate_new_page_family()\fP\fP function along with the size of the structure\&.
.PP
\fBParameters\fP
.RS 4
\fIstruct_name\fP The name of the memory structure to be registered\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBNote\fP
.RS 4
This macro should be used to register each memory structure before it is instantiated as a page family within the memory manager\&. It ensures proper initialization of the memory management system and enables efficient allocation and management of memory pages\&.

.SS "#define XCALLOC(units, struct_name)   (\fBxcalloc\fP(#struct_name, units))"

.PP
Macro for allocating memory for multiple instances of a structure and initializing them to zero\&. This macro simplifies the process of allocating memory for multiple instances of a structure and initializing them to zero\&. It takes the number of units and the name of the structure as input parameters\&.
.PP
\fBParameters\fP
.RS 4
\fIunits\fP The number of instances of the structure to allocate memory for\&. 
.br
\fIstruct_name\fP The name of the structure for which memory is to be allocated\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBReturns\fP
.RS 4
A pointer to the allocated memory, initialized to zero, or NULL if allocation fails\&.

.SS "#define XFREE(ptr)   (\fBxfree\fP(ptr))"

.PP
Macro for freeing memory using a custom deallocation function\&. This macro is used for freeing memory using a custom deallocation function specified by the user\&. The macro takes a pointer to the memory to be freed as its argument and passes it to the custom deallocation function \fBxfree()\fP\&.
.PP
\fBParameters\fP
.RS 4
\fIptr\fP Pointer to the memory to be freed\&. UAPI_MM_H_

.SH "Function Documentation"
.PP 
.SS "void mm_init ()"

.PP
Initializes the memory manager\&. This function initializes the memory manager\&. It sets up necessary configurations and parameters for memory management operations within the program\&. It specifically determines the system page size using the \fCgetpagesize()\fP system call and assigns it to the global variable \fCSYSTEM_PAGE_SIZE\fP\&.
.PP
\fBNote\fP
.RS 4
This function should be called before any memory management operations are performed within the program\&. It is typically called at the beginning of the program execution to ensure proper initialization of memory management functionalities\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBWarning\fP
.RS 4
This function relies on the \fCgetpagesize()\fP system call to determine the system page size\&. Therefore, it may not be portable across all platforms\&. It is primarily intended for use in Unix-like systems where \fCgetpagesize()\fP is available\&.
.RE

.SS "void mm_instantiate_new_page_family (char * struct_name, uint32_t struct_size)"

.PP
Instantiates a new page family for a memory structure\&. This function creates a new page family for a memory structure identified by its name and size\&. It allocates memory for the page family and adds it to the existing virtual memory pages if necessary\&. Each page family can contain multiple memory structures of the same type\&.
.PP
\fBParameters\fP
.RS 4
\fIstruct_name\fP The name of the memory structure\&. 
.br
\fIstruct_size\fP The size of the memory structure\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBNote\fP
.RS 4
If the size of the memory structure exceeds the system page size, an error message is printed, and the function returns without creating the page family\&.
.PP
This function maintains a linked list of virtual memory pages (\fCfirst_vm_page_for_families\fP) to store the page families\&. If there are no existing pages, it allocates a new page and initializes it with the first page family\&. If the existing pages are full, it allocates a new page and adds it to the beginning of the linked list\&.
.PP
If a page family with the same name already exists, an assertion error is triggered, indicating a conflict in page family instantiation\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBWarning\fP
.RS 4
This function relies on the \fC\fBmm_get_new_vm_page_from_kernel()\fP\fP function to allocate memory from the kernel for the page family\&. Improper use or misuse of this function can lead to memory leaks or system instability\&.
.RE
.PP

.SS "void mm_print_block_usage ()"

.PP
Prints information about the memory block usage\&. This function iterates through all virtual memory pages and their associated memory block families to print information about the memory block usage, including the total block count, free block count, occupied block count, and application memory usage\&. 
.SS "void mm_print_memory_usage (char * struct_name)"

.PP
Prints memory usage details related to the memory manager\&. This function prints information about the memory usage of the memory manager, including details of each virtual memory page family and the total memory being used\&. Optionally, it can filter the output by a specific structure name\&.
.PP
\fBParameters\fP
.RS 4
\fIstruct_name\fP Optional parameter to filter the output by a specific structure name\&. 
.RE
.PP

.SS "void mm_print_registered_page_families ()"

.PP
Prints all registered page families\&. This function prints all page families that have been registered with the Linux Memory Manager\&. It iterates over all virtual memory pages hosting page families and prints information about each page family, including its name and size\&.
.PP
\fBNote\fP
.RS 4
This function should be invoked after the application has performed registration for all its structures using the \fCMM_REG_STRUCT\fP macro\&. It relies on the \fCfirst_vm_page_for_families\fP global variable, which maintains a linked list of virtual memory pages containing page families\&.

.SS "void* xcalloc (char * struct_name, int units)"

.PP
Allocates and initializes memory for an array of structures\&. This function allocates memory for an array of structures of the specified type and initializes the memory to zero\&. It first looks up the page family associated with the specified structure name to determine the size of the structure\&. Then, it checks if the requested memory size exceeds the maximum allocatable memory per page\&. If the allocation is successful, it initializes the allocated memory to zero and returns a pointer to the allocated memory\&.
.PP
\fBParameters\fP
.RS 4
\fIstruct_name\fP The name of the structure type for which memory is to be allocated\&. 
.br
\fIunits\fP The number of structures to allocate\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBReturns\fP
.RS 4
A pointer to the allocated memory if successful, or NULL if the allocation fails\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBNote\fP
.RS 4
This function assumes that the specified structure type has been registered with the Memory Manager using the mm_register_structure function\&. It also assumes that the specified structure type has a corresponding page family registered with the Memory Manager\&. 
.RE
.PP

.SS "void xfree (void * app_data)"

.PP
Frees memory allocated by the memory manager\&. This function is used to free memory that was previously allocated by the memory manager\&. It takes a pointer to the memory to be freed as its argument\&. The pointer is adjusted to point to the block metadata, and then it is passed to the memory manager's free blocks function\&.
.PP
\fBParameters\fP
.RS 4
\fIapp_data\fP Pointer to the memory to be freed\&.
