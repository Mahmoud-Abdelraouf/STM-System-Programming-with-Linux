## The Linux Programming Interface

In the second part of the training, we studied "The Linux Programming Interface," which provided an in-depth understanding of system programming concepts and APIs used in Linux.

### Key Topics:
- Comprehensive study of system calls and library functions.
- Detailed exploration of file I/O, process management, and IPC.
- In-depth understanding of memory management and networking.

## Project: Linux Memory Manager

As a practical application of the concepts learned, we developed a project focused on creating a Linux memory manager. This project involved:

### Memory Allocation and Deallocation

Implementing custom memory allocation and deallocation routines.

### Memory Mapping

Understanding and utilizing memory mapping techniques.

### Virtual Memory Management

Exploring virtual memory concepts and implementing a basic virtual memory manager.

### Project Highlights:
- Designing and implementing a custom memory allocator.
- Handling memory fragmentation and optimizing allocation strategies.
- Mapping files into memory and managing memory-mapped regions.
- Creating a basic virtual memory manager to handle paging and segmentation.
