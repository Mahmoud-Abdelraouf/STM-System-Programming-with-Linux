## Linux History

We delved into the history of Linux, exploring its origins, development milestones, and the philosophy behind open-source software.

### Key Topics:
- Origins and evolution of Linux.
- Key milestones in Linux development.
- Philosophy and principles of open-source software.

## Command Line Usage and Build Process

Understanding the command line interface is fundamental to working with Linux-based embedded systems. We learned how to navigate the command line efficiently and explored the build process for compiling and linking software applications.

### Key Topics:
- Navigating the command line.
- Commonly used command line commands.
- Build process for compiling and linking applications.

## Process Management

### Process Overview

Understanding the concept of processes in Linux and how they interact with the operating system.

### System Calls and Command Line Arguments

Exploring system calls and their role in process management, along with handling command line arguments in C programs.

### Process Creation

Learning about process creation using functions such as `fork()` and `exec()`.

### Orphan & Zombie Processes

Understanding the concepts of orphan and zombie processes and their implications on system resources.

### Bash Features

Exploring advanced features of the Bash shell for scripting and automation.

### Intro to Proc fs

Introduction to the `/proc` filesystem and its role in providing information about processes and system resources.

### IO Redirection in the Shell

Mastering input/output redirection techniques in the shell for efficient command-line usage.

## User Management

We covered user management concepts, including user account administration, permissions, and security practices.

### Key Topics:
- User account administration.
- Managing permissions and access control.
- Security practices for user management.

## Filesystem Management

### Intro to HDD

Understanding hard disk drive (HDD) fundamentals and their role in storing data on embedded systems.

### Parsing MBR Partition Tables

Exploring Master Boot Record (MBR) partition tables and techniques for parsing them.

### File System Formatting, Mounting, and Architecture

Learning about file system formats, mounting procedures, and the underlying architecture of file systems.

### Directories, Files, Links, and Permissions

Understanding the structure of directories and files, symbolic and hard links, and managing permissions for file access control.

### Implementing “ls”

Developing a simplified version of the `ls` command to list directory contents.
