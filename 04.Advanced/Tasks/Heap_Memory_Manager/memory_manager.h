 * @brief Macro to declare a conversion function for converting a glthread_t

 *
 * This macro simplifies the process of declaring a conversion function that

 * It is particularly useful when you have a glthread_t structure embedded
 * within a user-defined structure and need to access the user-defined data.

 * @param struct_type The type of the user-defined structure.
 * @param glthread_member The name of the glthread_t member within the
 * user-defined structure.
 * @param glthread_ptr The name of the glthread_t pointer variable.
 *
 * Example usage:
 * Suppose we have a user-defined structure named block_meta_data_t that
 * contains a glthread_t member named priority_thread_glue. To declare a
 * conversion function named glthread_to_block_meta_data to convert a glthread_t
 * pointer to a block_meta_data_t pointer, we use the following declaration:
 *
 * GLTHREAD_TO_STRUCT(glthread_to_block_meta_data, block_meta_data_t,
 *                    priority_thread_glue, glthread_ptr);
 *
 * Now, we can use glthread_to_block_meta_data to convert glthread_t pointers to
 * block_meta_data_t pointers and access the metadata associated with memory
 * blocks.

 * - Sets the 'next_block' and 'prev_block' pointers of the block metadata to

 * - Sets the 'is_free' flag of the block metadata to MM_TRUE, indicating that
