## 1.0 HISTORY AND STANDARDS
- Linux is a member of the UNIX family of operating systems.
- One of the notable features of the UNIX system is that its development was not. controlled by a single vendor or organization.
- Rather, many groups, both commercial and noncommercial, contributed to its evolution.
- UNIX implementations diverged over time, so that writing applications that worked on all UNIX implementations became increasingly difficult 
- Two definitions of the term UNIX are in common use:
	- One of these denotes operating systems that have passed the official conformance tests for the Single UNIX Specification
	- The other common meaning attached to the term UNIX denotes those systems that look and behave like classical UNIX systems
## 1.1 A Brief History of UNIX and C
 - The first UNIX implementation was developed in [[1969]] by Ken Thompson at Bell Laboratories, a division of the telephone corporation, AT&T. It was written in assembler for a Digital PDP-7 minicomputer.
 - The name UNIX was a pun on MULTICS (Multiplexed Information and Computing Service), the name of an earlier operating system project in which AT&T collaborated with Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and General Electric.
 - (AT&T had by this time withdrawn from the project in frustration at its initial failure to develop an economically useful system.)
 - ==Thompson drew several ideas for his new operating system from MULTICS,== including ==a tree-structured file system,== a separate program for interpreting commands ==(the shell),== and the notion of ==files as unstructured streams of bytes.==
 - In 1970, UNIX was rewritten in assembly language for a newly acquired Digital PDP-11 minicomputer, then a new and powerful machine.
 - A short time later, [[Dennis Ritchie]], designed and implemented the [[C programming language]].
 - By 1973, C had matured to a point where the UNIX kernel could be almost entirely rewritten in the new language.
 - came one of the earliest operating systems to be written in a high-level language, a fact that made subsequent porting to other hardware architectures possible.
### **The birth of BSD and System V**
- January 1979 saw the release of Seventh Edition UNIX, which improved the reliability of the system and provided an enhanced file system.
- Thompson spent the 1975/1976 academic year as a visiting professor at the University of California at ==Berkeley.==
- In 1983, the _Computer Systems Research Group_ at the University of California at Berkeley released ==[[4.2BSD]].==
- This release was significant because it contained a complete TCP/IP implementation, including the sockets application programming interface (API) and a variety of networking tools.
## 1.2 A Brief History of Linux
- The term _Linux_ is commonly used to refer to the entire **UNIX-like** operating system
