## Training Content

### Part 1: Basic Internship

#### Linux History

We delved into the history of Linux, exploring its origins, development milestones, and the philosophy behind open-source software.

#### Command Line Usage and Build Process

Understanding the command line interface is fundamental to working with Linux-based embedded systems. We learned how to navigate the command line efficiently and explored the build process for compiling and linking software applications.

#### Process Management

- **Process Overview:** Understanding the concept of processes in Linux and how they interact with the operating system.
  
- **System Calls and Command Line Arguments:** Exploring system calls and their role in process management, along with handling command line arguments in C programs.
  
- **Process Creation:** Learning about process creation using functions such as `fork()` and `exec()`.

- **Orphan & Zombie Processes:** Understanding the concepts of orphan and zombie processes and their implications on system resources.

- **Bash Features:** Exploring advanced features of the Bash shell for scripting and automation.

- **Intro to Proc fs:** Introduction to the `/proc` filesystem and its role in providing information about processes and system resources.

- **IO Redirection in the Shell:** Mastering input/output redirection techniques in the shell for efficient command-line usage.

#### User Management

We covered user management concepts, including user account administration, permissions, and security practices.

#### Filesystem Management

- **Intro to HDD:** Understanding hard disk drive (HDD) fundamentals and their role in storing data on embedded systems.

- **Parsing MBR Partition Tables:** Exploring Master Boot Record (MBR) partition tables and techniques for parsing them.

- **File System Formatting, Mounting, and Architecture:** Learning about file system formats, mounting procedures, and the underlying architecture of file systems.

- **Directories, Files, Links, and Permissions:** Understanding the structure of directories and files, symbolic and hard links, and managing permissions for file access control.

- **Implementing “ls”:** Developing a simplified version of the `ls` command to list directory contents.

### Part 2: Advanced Training

#### The Linux Programming Interface

In the second part of the training, we studied "The Linux Programming Interface," which provided an in-depth understanding of system programming concepts and APIs used in Linux.

#### Project: Linux Memory Manager

As a practical application of the concepts learned, we developed a project focused on creating a Linux memory manager. This project involved:

- **Memory Allocation and Deallocation:** Implementing custom memory allocation and deallocation routines.
- **Memory Mapping:** Understanding and utilizing memory mapping techniques.
- **Virtual Memory Management:** Exploring virtual memory concepts and implementing a basic virtual memory manager.

### Part 3: Current Training

#### Introduction to Assembly Language

- **Objective:** Demonstrate the portability of the UNIX/Linux interface through the use of assembly system calls in Glibc.
- **Key Topics:**
  - Basics of assembly language and its importance in low-level programming.
  - How system calls are implemented in assembly within the Glibc environment.
  - Calling conventions across different processors (e.g., x86, ARM).

#### Tutorial on POSIX Threads

- **Objective:** Explore the Native POSIX Thread Library (NPTL) and relevant kernel implementations.
- **Key Topics:**
  - Overview of POSIX threads (pthreads) and thread management.
  - Detailed walkthrough of thread creation, synchronization, and management in Linux.
  - Examination of kernel-level support for threading.

#### Signals as a Means of Interprocess Communications

- **Objective:** Discuss the role of signals in IPC and related system concepts.
- **Key Topics:**
  - Fundamentals of UNIX signals and their role in controlling processes.
  - Process states, Job Control, and pseudo terminals (PTYs).
  - Use cases and limitations of signals in modern IPC.

#### Introduction to Kernel Modules

- **Key Topics:**
  - Introduction to the Yocto project and its architecture.
  - Building a minimal Linux system for embedded devices.
  - Comparison with Debian-like file systems built using Bootstrap and Multistrap.

#### Kernel Namespaces and Container Software

- **Objective:** Examine how Linux namespaces support containerization technologies.
- **Key Topics:**
  - Overview of Linux namespaces (PID, net, IPC, mount, etc.).
  - Practical demonstrations using Docker, Podman, and Systemd-nspawn.
  - System calls associated with namespaces management.

#### Fundamentals of TCP/IP and Socket Programming
