## Installation Guide

### 1. Clone the Repository

First, clone this repository to your local machine using Git:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/orcalinux/youtube_downloader.git
cd youtube_downloader
```

### 2. Using the Makefile (Recommended)

A `Makefile` is provided to automate the setup process, including creating a virtual environment, installing dependencies, and running the application.

#### **a. Ensure `make` is Installed**

- **Linux/macOS**: `make` is typically pre-installed. Verify by running:

  ```bash
  make --version
  ```

- **Windows**: Install [Make for Windows](http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/make.htm) or use [Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) to access Unix-like tools.

#### **b. Set Up the Virtual Environment and Install Dependencies**

Run the following command in the project directory:

```bash
make install
```

**What This Does:**

- Creates a virtual environment named `venv`.
- Installs Python dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`.
- Checks if `ffmpeg` is installed on your system.

_If `ffmpeg` is not installed, follow the instructions in [Manual Setup](#3-manual-setup) to install it._

#### **c. Run the Application**

After installation, execute the script using:

```bash
make run
```

**What This Does:**

- Activates the virtual environment.
- Runs `app.py` within the virtual environment.

#### **d. Clean the Project**

To remove the virtual environment and clean up dependencies, use:

```bash
make clean
```

---

### 3. Manual Setup

If you prefer not to use the `Makefile`, follow these steps to set up the project manually.

#### **a. Create a Virtual Environment**

Navigate to the project directory and create a virtual environment named `venv`:

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
```

#### **b. Activate the Virtual Environment**

- **Linux/macOS:**

  ```bash
  source venv/bin/activate
  ```

- **Windows:**

  ```bash
  venv\Scripts\activate
  ```

#### **c. Install Python Dependencies**

With the virtual environment activated, install the required Python packages:

```bash
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### **d. Install `ffmpeg`**

Ensure `ffmpeg` is installed on your system.

- **Windows:**

  1. Download the latest `ffmpeg` release from [ffmpeg.org](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html).
  2. Extract the downloaded archive.
  3. Add the `bin` directory of `ffmpeg` to your system's PATH.

- **Linux:**

  ```bash
  sudo apt-get update
  sudo apt-get install ffmpeg
  ```

- **macOS (Using Homebrew):**

  ```bash
  brew install ffmpeg
  ```

---

## Usage

After setting up the environment and installing dependencies, you can run the YouTube downloader script.

### **Run the Script**

Activate the virtual environment (if not already activated):

- **Linux/macOS:**

  ```bash
  source venv/bin/activate
  ```

- **Windows:**

  ```bash
  venv\Scripts\activate
  ```

Run the application:

```bash
python app.py
```

### **Follow the Prompts**

1. **Enter the URL**: Provide the URL of the YouTube video or playlist you wish to download.
2. **Select Playlist or Single Video**: If the URL is a playlist, choose whether to download the entire playlist or specific videos.
3. **Choose Quality**: Select your preferred video quality (Best, High, Medium, Low).
4. **Download**: The script will download the selected video(s) and save them to your `Downloads` folder.

## Examples

### Example 1: Downloading a Single Video

```bash
python app.py
```

- **Input**:
  - **URL**: `https://youtu.be/W13gbCLVU40`
  - **Quality**: `2` (High 1080p)
- **Output**: The video is downloaded and saved to your `Downloads` folder.

### Example 2: Downloading an Entire Playlist

```bash
python app.py
```

- **Input**:
  - **URL**: `https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLxwbQuwnqw4fFmABIFU_xFP-Sp5DKW-b2`
  - **Download Entire Playlist**: `y`
  - **Quality**: `1` (Best quality)
- **Output**: All videos in the playlist are downloaded to your `Downloads` folder.

### Example 3: Downloading Specific Videos from a Playlist

```bash
python app.py
```

- **Input**:
  - **URL**: `https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLxwbQuwnqw4fFmABIFU_xFP-Sp5DKW-b2`
  - **Download Entire Playlist**: `n`
  - **Select Videos**: `1, 3, 5`
  - **Quality**: `3` (Medium quality)
- **Output**: Only videos 1, 3, and 5 from the playlist are downloaded to your `Downloads` folder.

---

## Troubleshooting

- **Network Errors**: Ensure your internet connection is stable.
- **Permission Issues**: Make sure you have write permissions to the `Downloads` directory.
- **Missing Dependencies**: Verify that `yt-dlp` and `ffmpeg` are installed correctly and accessible via your system's PATH.
- **ModuleNotFoundError**: If you encounter `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'yt_dlp'`, ensure you've installed `yt-dlp` within your virtual environment:

  ```bash
  pip install yt-dlp
  ```

- **ffmpeg Not Found**: If the script cannot locate `ffmpeg`, ensure it is installed and added to your system's PATH.
