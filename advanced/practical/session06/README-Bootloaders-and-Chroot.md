## Bootloaders Overview

### GRUB (Grand Unified Bootloader)

GRUB is a powerful and flexible bootloader used by many Linux distributions. It supports multiple operating systems and provides a menu to choose between them at startup.

#### Features of GRUB:
- **Automatic Detection**: GRUB automatically detects multiple operating systems on the same machine and adds them to the boot menu.
- **Customizable**: Highly customizable with support for various themes, boot options, and timeout settings.
- **Community Support**: Extensive documentation and community support.

#### Configuring GRUB:
GRUB's configuration file is typically located at `/etc/default/grub` and `/boot/grub/grub.cfg`. The main configuration file can be edited to customize the boot menu.

##### Example:
```bash
sudo nano /etc/default/grub
```

Key settings include:
- `GRUB_DEFAULT`: The default entry to boot.
- `GRUB_TIMEOUT`: The number of seconds to wait before booting the default entry.
- `GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX`: Additional kernel parameters.

After making changes, update GRUB with:
```bash
sudo update-grub
```

### Windows Boot Manager

The Windows Boot Manager is the default bootloader for Windows operating systems. It primarily manages the boot process for Windows and can be configured to include other OSes manually.

#### Features of Windows Boot Manager:
- **Default Behavior**: Primarily designed to boot into Windows. Does not automatically detect non-Windows OS installations.
- **Configuration Required**: Requires manual configuration using tools like `bcdedit` to add entries for other operating systems.

#### Configuring Windows Boot Manager:
To add an entry for another operating system, use the `bcdedit` command.

##### Example:
```bash
bcdedit /create {bootmgr} /d "Linux"
bcdedit /set {bootmgr} path \EFI\ubuntu\grubx64.efi
```

### U-Boot (Universal Boot Loader)

U-Boot is a popular bootloader for embedded systems, widely used in devices like development boards, IoT devices, and custom hardware.

#### Features of U-Boot:
- **Flexibility**: Supports a wide range of architectures and hardware platforms.
- **Customizability**: Highly customizable with support for various boot methods and filesystems.
- **Debugging**: Provides robust debugging capabilities.

#### Configuring U-Boot:
U-Boot is configured through environment variables and scripts. The configuration process typically involves compiling U-Boot with specific settings for the target hardware.

##### Example:
```bash
make CROSS_COMPILE=arm-linux-gnueabihf- <board_name>_defconfig
make CROSS_COMPILE=arm-linux-gnueabihf-
```

## Why Use GRUB Over Windows Boot Manager

- **Multi-OS Detection**: GRUB's ability to automatically detect and configure multiple operating systems makes it more user-friendly for dual-boot setups.
- **Ease of Use**: Setting up GRUB to handle booting for different OSes is generally simpler and less error-prone compared to configuring the Windows Boot Manager.
- **Flexibility**: GRUB supports a wide range of options and customizations that can cater to advanced boot configurations.

## Setting GRUB as the Primary Bootloader

To ensure GRUB is the primary bootloader and provides a menu to select between Ubuntu and Windows, follow these steps:

### Example: Listing All Bootloaders

Run the following command to list all the bootloaders:
```bash
sudo efibootmgr
```

#### Output:
```plaintext
BootCurrent: 0001
Timeout: 0 seconds
BootOrder: 0001,0004,2001,2002,2003
Boot0001* ubuntu
Boot0002* EFI PXE 0 for IPv4 (xx-xx-xx-xx-xx-xx) 
Boot0003* EFI PXE 0 for IPv6 (xx-xx-xx-xx-xx-xx) 
Boot0004* Windows Boot Manager
Boot2001* EFI USB Device
Boot2002* EFI DVD/CDROM
Boot2003* EFI Network
```

### Set Boot Order Using efibootmgr

To make GRUB the primary bootloader, set the boot order such that Ubuntu (GRUB) is the first option:
```bash
sudo efibootmgr -o 0001,0004,2001,2002,2003
```

### Verify the Changes

Verify the changes to ensure the boot order is set correctly:
```bash
sudo efibootmgr
```

## Understanding Mount Namespace in Linux

### Mount Namespace

Mount namespaces provide isolation of the filesystem mount points between processes. This allows different processes to have different views of the filesystem hierarchy.

#### Creating a New Mount Namespace

```bash
unshare --mount
```

#### Running a Process in a New Mount Namespace

```bash
unshare --mount --propagation private /bin/bash
```

#### Practical Use Case: Isolating Mounts

You can use mount namespaces to isolate mounts for containers or sandbox environments.

##### Example:

1. **Create a New Namespace**:
    ```bash
    unshare --mount --propagation private /bin/bash
    ```

2. **Mount a Filesystem in the New Namespace**:
    ```bash
    mount -t tmpfs none /mnt
    ```

The mount will only be visible within this new namespace.

## Using chroot and --bind

### What is chroot?

`chroot` is a command in Unix and Unix-like operating systems that changes the apparent root directory for the current running process and its children. This new root directory is referred to as a "chroot jail." It is primarily used for security purposes, to isolate a process from the rest of the system, and for system recovery.

### Why Use chroot?

- **Security**: Isolates applications from the main filesystem.
- **Development**: Creates a controlled environment for testing.
- **System Recovery**: Repairs broken systems by booting from a live environment and chrooting into the installed system.

### Basic Usage of chroot

#### Syntax

```bash
sudo chroot /path/to/new/root /bin/bash
```

#### Explanation

- **/path/to/new/root**: The directory that will become the new root directory.
- **/bin/bash**: The shell to run within the chroot environment.

#### Example

```bash
sudo chroot /mnt /bin/bash
```

### Detailed Steps for chroot

1. **Boot into a Live Linux Environment**
   Use a live CD/USB (referred to as Computer B) to boot into a Linux environment.

2. **Mount the Root Filesystem of the Primary OS (Computer A)**
   ```bash
   sudo mount /dev/sda1 /mnt
   ```

3. **Mount Necessary Filesystems**
   ```bash
   sudo mount --bind /dev /mnt/dev
   sudo mount --bind /proc /mnt/proc
   sudo mount --bind /sys /mnt/sys
   sudo mount --bind /dev/pts /mnt/dev/pts
   ```

4. **Change Root**
   ```bash
   sudo chroot /mnt
   ```

5. **Perform System Maintenance**
   You can now run commands as if you were booted into the mounted filesystem.

   ##### Example: Updating GRUB in chroot
   ```bash
   sudo grub-install /dev/sda
   ```

## Use Case: Using chroot for System Recovery

### Scenario

You have a computer (Computer A) that is unable to boot due to a corrupted GRUB installation. You also have a live Linux USB (Computer B) that you can use to boot into a live environment and repair the system.

### Steps

1. **Boot into Live Linux Environment (Computer B)**: 
   Boot Computer A using the live Linux USB (Computer B).

2. **Identify the Root Filesystem**: 
   Determine the device name of the root filesystem. This is typically `/dev/sda1` for the first partition of the first drive.

3. **Mount the Root Filesystem**:
   ```bash
   sudo mount /dev/sda1 /mnt
   ```

4. **Mount Necessary Filesystems**:
   ```bash
   sudo mount

 --bind /dev /mnt/dev
   sudo mount --bind /proc /mnt/proc
   sudo mount --bind /sys /mnt/sys
   sudo mount --bind /dev/pts /mnt/dev/pts
   ```

5. **Chroot into the Mounted Filesystem**:
   ```bash
   sudo chroot /mnt
   ```

6. **Update GRUB**:
   ```bash
   sudo grub-install /dev/sda
   update-grub
   ```

7. **Exit chroot and Reboot**:
   ```bash
   exit
   sudo reboot
   ```

### Explanation

- **Boot into Live Environment**: Computer B is used to boot into a functional Linux environment.
- **Identify Root Filesystem**: Identify the device name of the root filesystem on Computer A.
- **Mount Filesystems**: Mount the root filesystem and necessary virtual filesystems.
- **Chroot**: Change the root to the mounted filesystem.
- **System Maintenance**: Run necessary commands to repair the system, such as reinstalling GRUB.
- **Reboot**: Exit the chroot environment and reboot the system to verify the fix.
