## 1. Introduction to Perl

Perl is a highly capable, feature-rich programming language with over 30 years of development. It is widely known for its text processing capabilities, especially with regular expressions, making it a powerful tool for system administration, web development, and more.

## 2. Basic Perl Usage

### 2.1 Running Perl Scripts

Perl scripts can be run directly from the command line or by creating a script file.

- **Example: Running a Perl Script File**

  Save the following script as `hello.pl`:

  ```perl
  #!/usr/bin/perl
  print "Hello, World!\n";
  ```

  Run the script using:

  ```bash
  perl hello.pl
  ```

### 2.2 Using Perl from the Command Line

You can execute one-liner scripts directly from the command line without creating a file.

- **Example: Printing a String**

  ```bash
  perl -e 'print "Hello, World!\n";'
  ```

- **Example: Using Perl to Match and Print a Pattern**

  ```bash
  echo "Hello World" | perl -ne 'print if /World/'
  ```

## 3. Introduction to Perl-Compatible Regular Expressions (PCRE)

PCRE is a library of functions that implement regular expression pattern matching using the same syntax and semantics as Perl 5. Regular expressions are sequences of characters that form search patterns, widely used for string matching and text manipulation.

### 3.1 Basic Syntax and Features

- **Anchors:**
  - `^`: Start of a string.
  - `$`: End of a string.

- **Character Classes:**
  - `[abc]`: Matches any one of the characters `a`, `b`, or `c`.
  - `[^abc]`: Matches any character except `a`, `b`, or `c`.
  - `[a-z]`: Matches any character in the range `a` to `z`.

- **Quantifiers:**
  - `*`: Matches 0 or more occurrences.
  - `+`: Matches 1 or more occurrences.
  - `?`: Matches 0 or 1 occurrence.
  - `{n,m}`: Matches between `n` and `m` occurrences.

- **Groups and Alternation:**
  - `(abc)`: Groups characters together.
  - `|`: Acts as a logical OR.

- **Lookahead and Lookbehind:**
  - `(?=...)`: Positive lookahead.
  - `(?!...)`: Negative lookahead.
  - `(?<=...)`: Positive lookbehind.
  - `(?<!...)`: Negative lookbehind.

### 3.2 Examples of PCRE

- **Matching an Email Address**

  ```perl
  my $email = 'user@example.com';
  if ($email =~ /^[\w\.-]+@[a-zA-Z\d\.-]+\.[a-zA-Z]{2,6}$/) {
      print "Valid email\n";
  }
  ```

- **Finding Repeated Words**

  ```perl
  my $text = 'This is a test test string';
  if ($text =~ /\b(\w+)\b \1/) {
      print "Repeated word found\n";
  }
  ```

- **Replacing Text**

  ```perl
  my $string = 'The color is red.';
  $string =~ s/color/colour/;
  print $string;  # Output: The colour is red.
  ```

## 4. Using `pcregrep`

`pcregrep` is a command-line utility similar to `grep` but uses Perl-compatible regular expressions (PCRE). It is useful when you need more advanced regex features not supported by basic `grep`.

### 4.1 Basic Usage

- **Syntax:**

  ```bash
  pcregrep [options] 'pattern' file
  ```

- **Example: Searching for an Email Pattern**

  ```bash
  pcregrep '^[\w\.-]+@[a-zA-Z\d\.-]+\.[a-zA-Z]{2,6}$' emails.txt
  ```

### 4.2 Advanced Examples

- **Finding Lines with Repeated Words**

  ```bash
  pcregrep '\b(\w+)\b \1' file.txt
  ```

- **Finding Lines that Start with a Specific Word**

  ```bash
  pcregrep '^Error' logfile.txt
  ```

- **Excluding Lines that Match a Pattern**

  ```bash
  pcregrep -v 'ERROR' logfile.txt
  ```

## 5. Perl and PCREgrep Examples

### 5.1 Finding Patterns in Text

- **Perl Example:**

  ```perl
  echo "user@example.com" | perl -ne 'print if /^[\w\.-]+@[a-zA-Z\d\.-]+\.[a-zA-Z]{2,6}$/'
  ```

- **PCREgrep Example:**

  ```bash
  echo "user@example.com" | pcregrep '^[\w\.-]+@[a-zA-Z\d\.-]+\.[a-zA-Z]{2,6}$'
  ```

### 5.2 Substituting Text

- **Perl Example:**

  ```perl
  echo "The color is red." | perl -pe 's/color/colour/'
  ```

- **PCREgrep Example (substitution not directly supported by `pcregrep`, but you can use Perl):**

  ```bash
  echo "The color is red." | perl -pe 's/color/colour/'
  ```

### 5.3 Using Lookaheads and Lookbehinds

- **Perl Example:**

  ```perl
  echo "foobar" | perl -ne 'print if /foo(?=bar)/'
  ```

- **PCREgrep Example:**

  ```bash
  echo "foobar" | pcregrep 'foo(?=bar)'
  ```

### 5.4 Working with Multiline Text

- **Perl Example:**

  ```perl
  perl -0777 -ne 'print if /foo.*?bar/s' file.txt
  ```

- **PCREgrep Example:**

  ```bash
  pcregrep -M 'foo.*?bar' file.txt
  ```

## 6. Conclusion

Perl and `pcregrep` are powerful tools for working with complex regular expressions, offering more flexibility and functionality than traditional tools like `grep`. Mastering Perl-compatible regular expressions (PCRE) will enhance your ability to search, manipulate, and process text efficiently.
