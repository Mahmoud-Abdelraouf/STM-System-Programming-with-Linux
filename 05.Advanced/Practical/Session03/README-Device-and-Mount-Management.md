# README - Managing Devices and Mount Points in Linux

## Overview

Managing devices and mount points is a crucial part of system administration in Linux. This guide covers how to list all devices on your computer, how to mount and unmount devices, and provides information on default mount points. It also includes commands for these operations.

## Listing All Devices

To manage devices, you first need to know which devices are available on your system. Here are some commands to list all devices:

- **List all block devices**:
  ```sh
  lsblk
  ```

- **List all mounted filesystems**:
  ```sh
  df -h
  ```

- **View detailed information about all devices**:
  ```sh
  sudo fdisk -l
  ```

- **List all storage devices (using `blkid`)**:
  ```sh
  sudo blkid
  ```

## Mounting Devices

Mounting a device means making the filesystem on the device accessible at a certain point in the directory tree. Here are the steps to mount a device:

1. **Identify the device**:
   Use `lsblk` or `sudo fdisk -l` to find the device name (e.g., `/dev/sdb1`).

2. **Create a mount point**:
   ```sh
   sudo mkdir -p /mnt/my_mount_point
   ```

3. **Mount the device**:
   ```sh
   sudo mount /dev/sdb1 /mnt/my_mount_point
   ```

4. **Verify the mount**:
   ```sh
   df -h | grep /mnt/my_mount_point
   ```

## Default Mount Points

Linux systems have several default mount points where devices are typically mounted. Here are some common ones:

- **`/` (Root Filesystem)**: This is the top-level directory of the filesystem hierarchy.
- **`/home`**: User home directories.
- **`/mnt`**: Common temporary mount point.
- **`/media`**: Mount point for removable media like USB drives and CDs.
- **`/boot`**: Boot files.

## Unmounting Devices

To unmount a device, use the `umount` command followed by the mount point or the device name:

- **Unmount using the mount point**:
  ```sh
  sudo umount /mnt/my_mount_point
  ```

- **Unmount using the device name**:
  ```sh
  sudo umount /dev/sdb1
  ```

- **Force unmount (use with caution)**:
  ```sh
  sudo umount -f /mnt/my_mount_point
  ```

| Mount a device                       | `sudo mount /dev/sdb1 /mnt/my_mount_point`   |
| Verify the mount                     | `df -h | grep /mnt/my_mount_point`           |
| Unmount using the mount point        | `sudo umount /mnt/my_mount_point`            |
