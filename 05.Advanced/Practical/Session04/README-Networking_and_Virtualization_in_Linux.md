## MAC and IP Address Resolution

### MAC Address

- A unique identifier assigned to network interfaces for communications at the data link layer.
- Format: 48-bit address, usually written as six groups of two hexadecimal digits separated by colons.

### IP Address
- A numerical label assigned to each device connected to a computer network that uses the Internet Protocol for communication.

### ARP Process in Detail
1. **Device A wants to communicate with Device B** within the same network.
2. **Device A broadcasts an ARP request** to all devices on the local network: "Who has IP address 192.168.1.2? Tell 192.168.1.1."
3. **Device B receives the ARP request** and replies with its MAC address: "192.168.1.2 is at MAC address 00:14:22:01:23:45."
4. **Device A stores the MAC address** in its ARP cache and uses it to send packets directly to Device B.

### Communicating with a Device on a Different Network
1. **Device A wants to communicate with Device B** on a different network.
2. **Device A checks its routing table** and finds the route to the default gateway (router).
3. **Device A sends packets to the router's MAC address**.
4. **The router forwards the packets** to Device B's network, using its routing table to determine the next hop.
5. **Device B receives the packets** and sends responses back to Device A through the router.

### Default Router in Linux
- A default router (or gateway) is the device that routes traffic from a local network to other networks or the internet.
- **Configuring the Default Gateway**:
  ```sh
  sudo ip route add default via <router-ip>
  ```
- **Example**:
  ```sh
  sudo ip route add default via 192.168.1.1
  ```

## Ethernet Packets and Ethernet Explanation

### What is Ethernet?
Ethernet is a family of wired networking technologies commonly used in local area networks (LANs), metropolitan area networks (MANs), and wide area networks (WANs). It defines wiring and signaling standards for the physical layer and data packet formats and protocols for the data link layer of the OSI model.

### Ethernet Frame Structure
An Ethernet frame is a data packet that includes information needed for data link layer transmission. The Ethernet frame format is standardized and consists of several fields:

1. **Preamble**: 7 bytes used to synchronize receiver clock.
2. **Start Frame Delimiter (SFD)**: 1 byte indicating the start of the frame.
3. **Destination MAC Address**: 6 bytes indicating the recipient's MAC address.
4. **Source MAC Address**: 6 bytes indicating the sender's MAC address.
5. **Type/Length**: 2 bytes indicating the type of protocol (e.g., IPv4, IPv6) or the length of the payload.
6. **Payload**: Variable length data (up to 1500 bytes) containing the encapsulated data from higher layers.
7. **Frame Check Sequence (FCS)**: 4 bytes used for error checking.

### Ethernet Frame Format

| Field                 | Size (Bytes) |
|-----------------------|--------------|
| Preamble              | 7            |
| Start Frame Delimiter | 1            |
| Destination MAC       | 6            |
| Source MAC            | 6            |
| Type/Length           | 2            |
| Payload               | 46-1500      |
| Frame Check Sequence  | 4            |

### Ethernet Operation
Ethernet operates by transmitting data in packets called frames between devices connected via cables. Each device on an Ethernet network has a unique MAC address, which it uses to communicate with other devices.

### Example Ethernet Frame

- **Preamble**: `10101010 10101010 10101010 10101010 10101010 10101010 10101010`
- **SFD**: `10101011`
- **Destination MAC**: `00:14:22:01:23:45`
- **Source MAC**: `00:14:22:01:23:46`
- **Type**: `0800` (IPv4)
- **Payload**: Data from higher layer protocols.
- **FCS**: CRC value for error checking.

### Ethernet Transmission Process
1. **Frame Creation**: The sending device creates an Ethernet frame encapsulating the data to be sent.
2. **Frame Transmission**: The frame is transmitted over the Ethernet cable to the destination device.
3. **Frame Reception**: The receiving device captures the frame and checks the destination MAC address.
4. **Error Checking**: The receiving device uses the FCS to check for errors.
5. **Frame Processing**: If no errors are found, the receiving device processes the payload.

### Advantages and Disadvantages of Ethernet
- **Advantages**:
  - High speed and reliability.
  - Widely used and standardized.
  - Cost-effective for LANs.
- **Disadvantages**:
  - Limited range without repeaters or switches.
  - Susceptible to physical damage and interference.

  - To view the routing table: `ip route show`

#### ICMP and ARP
- **ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol)**: Used for error messages and operational information (e.g., `ping` command).
- **ARP (Address Resolution Protocol)**: Resolves IP addresses to MAC (hardware) addresses within a local network.

#### Data Transmission in a Network
When a device wants to communicate with another device:

1. **Local Network**:
   - The sender sends an ARP request to get the MAC address of the recipient.
   - If the recipient is in the same network, it responds with its MAC address.
   - Data is then sent directly to the recipient using the MAC address.

2. **Different Network**:
   - The sender sends data to the default gateway (router).
   - The router forwards the data to the next router, and this process continues until the data reaches the recipient’s network.
   - ARP is used within each local network to resolve MAC addresses.

#### ARP and ICMP
- **ARP (Address Resolution Protocol)**: Resolves IP addresses to MAC (hardware) addresses within a local network. 
- **ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol)**: Used for error messages and operational information (e.g., `ping` command).

##### Example of ARP
1. **Local Network Communication**:
   - **Sender**: Sends an ARP request to get the MAC address of the recipient.
   - **Recipient**: If in the same network, it responds with its MAC address.
   - **Data Transmission**: Data is sent directly to the recipient using the MAC address.

2. **Different Network Communication**:
   - **Sender**: Sends data to the default gateway (router).
   - **Router**: Forwards the data to the next router, and this process continues until the data reaches the recipient’s network.
   - **ARP**: Used within each local network to resolve MAC addresses.

##### Types of Casts
- **Unicast**: Communication between a single sender and a single receiver.
- **Broadcast**: Communication from one sender to all possible receivers in the network.
- **Multicast**: Communication from one sender to a group of receivers.

#### ARP Packet
- **Purpose**: Determine the MAC address corresponding to an IP address.
- **Process**: 
  - **Sender**: Broadcasts an ARP request asking "Who has IP address X?"
  - **Recipient**: Responds with its MAC address.

## IPv6 Addressing

### IP Address Format
- **IPv6**: 128-bit address, written as eight groups of four hexadecimal digits (e.g., `2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334`).

### IPv6 Features
- **Larger Address Space**: Provides a virtually unlimited number of IP addresses.
- **Simplified Header**: Improves routing efficiency and performance.
- **Auto-Configuration**: Devices can automatically configure their own IP addresses.
- **Integrated Security**: IPsec is mandatory in IPv6.
- **No Broadcasts**: Uses multicast and anycast instead of broadcast.

### Example Address
- `2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334`

### Subnetting in IPv6
IPv6 uses prefix length to denote subnetting (similar to CIDR in IPv4).

- **Example**:
  - Global Unicast Address: `2001:0db8::/32`
  - Subnet ID: `2001:0db8:abcd::/48`
  - Interface ID: `2001:0db8:abcd:0012:0000:0000:0000:0001/64`

### Transition from IPv4 to IPv6
- **Dual Stack**: Devices run both IPv4 and IPv6.
- **Tunneling**: Encapsulating IPv6 traffic within IPv4 packets.
- **Translation**: Converting IPv6 packets to IPv4 packets and vice versa.

### Practical Usage
- Configure IPv6 on a network interface:
  ```sh
  sudo ip -6 addr add 2001:db8::1/64 dev eth0
  ```
- Add an IPv6 route:
  ```sh
  sudo ip -6 route add 2001:db8:abcd::/64 via 2001:db8::1
  ```
  
### Address Types
- **Unicast**: Identifies a single network interface.
- **Multicast**: Identifies multiple network interfaces.
- **Anycast**: Identifies the nearest of multiple network interfaces.

- Common messages: Echo Request (ping), Echo Reply (pong), Destination Unreachable.

### Packet Structure
1. **Type**: 8 bits, indicates the type of message.
2. **Code**: 8 bits, provides further information about the type.
3. **Checksum**: 16 bits, for error-checking.
4. **Rest of the Header**: Varies based on the type and code.

### Example
- **Ping**:
  - Type: 8 (Echo Request)
  - Code: 0

## ARP Packets

### ARP (Address Resolution Protocol)
- Used to map an IP address to a MAC address within a local network.

### ARP Process
1. **ARP Request**: Broadcasted by a device to find the MAC address associated with an IP address.
2. **ARP Reply**: Sent by the device with the requested IP address, containing its MAC address.

### Packet Structure
1. **Hardware Type**: 16 bits, indicates the network type (e.g., Ethernet).
2. **Protocol Type**: 16 bits, indicates the protocol (e.g., IP).
3. **Hardware Address Length**: 8 bits.
4. **Protocol Address Length**: 8 bits.

## VirtIO and Virtual Machines

### VirtIO
- A virtualization standard for network and disk device drivers.
- **Advantages**: Provides a more efficient interface between virtual machines and hypervisors, improving performance.

### Running Virtual Machines with QEMU
- **Example Command**:
  ```sh
  qemu-system-x86_64 -kernel bzImage -m 1G \
    -drive file=rootfs.img,if=virtio \
    -netdev tap,id=net0,ifname=tap0,script=no,downscript=no \
    -device virtio-net-pci,netdev=net0 \
    -append "root=/dev/vda rw" -daemonize
  ```

## Static Routing and Bridging

### Static Routing

Static routing is a type of network routing technique in which routes are manually configured and managed by the network administrator, as opposed to dynamic routing where routes are automatically adjusted by network protocols. Static routes are useful for small networks or for networks with a predictable and stable topology.

#### How Static Routing Works
Static routing involves manually adding routes to the routing table of a router or host. The routing table is a data structure that contains information about the paths that data packets take to reach their destinations. Each entry in the routing table specifies the destination network, the subnet mask, and the next-hop IP address (gateway).

#### Adding a Static Route
To add a static route, you use the `ip route add` command followed by the destination network and the gateway IP address.

- **Command**:
  ```sh
  sudo ip route add <network> via <gateway-ip>
  ```
- **Example**:
  To add a route to the network `192.168.2.0/24` via the gateway `192.168.1.1`, you would use the following command:
  ```sh
  sudo ip route add 192.168.2.0/24 via 192.168.1.1
  ```

This command tells the system that any traffic destined for the `192.168.2.0/24` network should be sent through the gateway `192.168.1.1`.

### Bridging

Bridging is a technique used to connect two or more network segments, making them function as a single network. A network bridge forwards traffic between these segments based on MAC addresses, effectively making the separate segments behave as one.

#### How Bridging Works
A bridge operates at the Data Link layer (Layer 2) of the OSI model and is used to connect different network segments. It filters and forwards traffic based on MAC addresses. By doing so, it reduces the collision domain but maintains the broadcast domain. This is useful in scenarios where you want to extend the network without adding routers.

#### Creating a Network Bridge
To create a bridge, you use the `ip link add` command to create a bridge interface, and the `ip link set` command to bring the bridge interface up.

- **Commands**:
  ```sh
  sudo ip link add name br0 type bridge
  sudo ip link set dev br0 up
  ```

#### Adding Interfaces to the Bridge
Once the bridge is created, you can add network interfaces to it. This is done by using the `ip link set` command to set the network interfaces as members of the bridge.

- **Commands**:
  ```sh
  sudo ip link set dev eth0 master br0
  sudo ip link set dev tap0 master br0
  ```

In this example, `eth0` and `tap0` are added to the bridge `br0`. This effectively makes `eth0` and `tap0` part of the same network segment.

### Practical Examples

#### Adding a Static Route
```sh
sudo ip route add 192.168.2.0/24 via 192.168.1.1
```

#### Creating a Bridge
```sh
sudo ip link add name br0 type bridge
sudo ip link set dev br0 up
```

#### Adding Interfaces to the Bridge
```sh
sudo ip link set dev eth0 master br0
sudo ip link set dev tap0 master br0
```

By understanding and utilizing static routing and bridging, network administrators can effectively manage and optimize network traffic, ensuring efficient and reliable communication within and across networks.
