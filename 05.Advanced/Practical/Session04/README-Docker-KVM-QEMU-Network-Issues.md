## Overview

When using Docker and KVM/QEMU on a system with a bridged network setup, Docker's default behavior of modifying IPTables can cause network connectivity issues for VMs. This guide provides steps to resolve these issues.

## Identifying the Issue

When Docker starts, it modifies the IPTables rules, setting the `FORWARD` chain policy to `DROP` and adding its own rules. This can prevent VMs using a bridged network from communicating correctly.

## Solution 1: Disabling Docker's IPTables Modification

Disabling Docker's IPTables modification can be a quick solution, but it might prevent Docker containers from accessing the network.

1. **Edit Docker's Service File**

   Open Docker's service file for editing:

   ```sh
   sudo systemctl edit docker
   ```

2. **Add the IPTables Flag**

   Add the following line to disable Docker's IPTables modification:

   ```ini
   [Service]
   ExecStart=
   ExecStart=/usr/bin/dockerd --iptables=false
   ```

3. **Restart Docker**

   Restart the Docker service to apply the changes:

   ```sh
   sudo systemctl daemon-reload
   sudo systemctl restart docker
   ```

## Solution 2: Adjusting IPTables Rules

If disabling Docker's IPTables modification causes issues with Docker containers, you can adjust the IPTables rules manually.

1. **Allow Forwarding for the Bridge**

   Add a rule to allow forwarding for the bridged network interface (e.g., `br0`):

   ```sh
   sudo iptables -P FORWARD ACCEPT
   sudo iptables -A FORWARD -p all -i br0 -j ACCEPT
   ```

2. **Persist the IPTables Rule**

   To make the rule persistent, you can add it to the Docker service configuration:

   ```sh
   sudo systemctl edit docker
   ```

3. **Add the IPTables Rules**

   Add the following lines to ensure the rules are set before Docker starts:

   ```ini
   [Service]
   ExecStartPre=/usr/bin/iptables -D FORWARD -p all -i br0 -j ACCEPT
   ExecStartPre=/usr/bin/iptables -A FORWARD -p all -i br0 -j ACCEPT
   ```

4. **Restart Docker**

   Restart the Docker service to apply the changes:

   ```sh
   sudo systemctl daemon-reload
   sudo systemctl restart docker
   ```

## Permanent Solution

To automate the process of adjusting IPTables rules, you can add post-up and pre-down commands to your network configuration file.

1. **Edit Network Configuration**

   Open your network configuration file for editing:

   ```sh
   sudo nano /etc/network/interfaces
   ```

2. **Add IPTables Commands**

   Add the following lines to your network interface configuration:

   ```sh
   auto br0
   iface br0 inet static
       address 192.168.1.2
       netmask 255.255.255.0
       bridge_ports eno1
       bridge_stp off
       bridge_fd 0
       bridge_maxwait 0
       post-up /usr/bin/iptables -A FORWARD -p all -i br0 -j ACCEPT
       pre-down /usr/bin/iptables -D FORWARD -p all -i br0 -j ACCEPT
   ```

3. **Restart Networking**

   Restart the networking service to apply the changes:

   ```sh
   sudo systemctl restart networking
   ```

## Additional Notes

- **Network Conflicts:** If you encounter network conflicts, such as IP address collisions, consider adjusting the subnet of your bridge network using the `--subnet` flag when creating custom Docker networks.
- **Security Considerations:** Changing the default policy of the `FORWARD` chain to `ACCEPT` can have security implications. Ensure that your host is adequately protected if it is exposed to untrusted networks.
