## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following packages and tools installed on your system:

- Git
- CMake
- Python 3
- Other essential tools for building software (gcc, make, etc.)

---

## Podman Installation

Podman is a daemonless container engine for developing, managing, and running OCI Containers on your Linux system.

### Installation on Ubuntu 22.04

To install Podman on Ubuntu 22.04, run the following commands:

```sh
sudo apt update
sudo apt install podman
```

---

## Using Podman

### Searching for Images

To search for images on Docker Hub, use the `podman search` command:

```sh
podman search nginx --filter=is-official
```

This command searches for images related to "nginx" on Docker Hub and filters for official images only. Here is an example output:

```sh
INDEX       NAME                     DESCRIPTION                                      STARS       OFFICIAL    AUTOMATED
docker.io   docker.io/library/nginx  Official build of Nginx.                         19857       [OK]
docker.io   docker.io/library/unit   Official build of NGINX Unit: Universal Web ...  29          [OK]
```

### Pulling Images

To pull an image from Docker Hub, use the `podman pull` command:

```sh
podman pull docker.io/library/nginx
```

Example output:

```sh
Trying to pull docker.io/library/nginx:latest...

```

### Running Containers

To run a container from the pulled image:

```sh
podman run --name basic_httpd -dt -p 8080:80/tcp docker.io/nginx
```

This command runs an Nginx container, mapping port 8080 on your host to port 80 in the container.

### Managing Containers

- **List running containers**:

  ```sh
  podman ps
  ```

  Example output:

  ```sh
  CONTAINER ID  IMAGE                           COMMAND               CREATED         STATUS             PORTS                 NAMES
  e5c5c256d422  docker.io/library/nginx:latest  nginx -g daemon o...  45 seconds ago  Up 45 seconds ago  0.0.0.0:8080->80/tcp  basic_httpd
  ```

- **List all containers**:

  ```sh
  podman ps -a
  ```

  Example output:

  ```sh
  CONTAINER ID  IMAGE                           COMMAND               CREATED      STATUS                  PORTS                 NAMES
  8fa0fe0d9a6b  docker.io/library/nginx:latest  nginx -g daemon o...  6 weeks ago  Exited (0) 6 weeks ago  0.0.0.0:8080->80/tcp  basic_httpd
  4a65496986e4  docker.io/library/nginx:latest  nginx -g daemon o...  5 weeks ago  Exited (0) 5 weeks ago  0.0.0.0:8080->80/tcp  st_httpd
  ```

- **Start a stopped container**:

  ```sh
  podman start 8fa0fe0d9a6b
  ```

- **Stop a running container**:

  ```sh
  podman stop 8fa0fe0d9a6b
  ```

- **Inspect a container**:

  ```sh
  podman inspect 8fa0fe0d9a6b | grep '"Name"'
  ```

  Example output:

  ```sh
  "Name": "basic_httpd",
  ```

You can start and stop containers by name as well:

```sh
podman start "basic_httpd"
podman stop "basic_httpd"
```

---

## Configuring Registries

To configure container registries, edit the `/etc/containers/registries.conf` file.

### Example Configuration

To set Docker Hub as the default unqualified search registry:

```sh
unqualified-search-registries = ["docker.io"]
```

To change the default search registry to Red Hat:

```sh
unqualified-search-registries = ["registry.redhat.io"]
```

### Searching Specific Registries

- **Search Docker Hub**:

  ```sh
  podman search docker.io/httpd
  ```

- **Search Red Hat Registry**:

  ```sh
  podman search registry.redhat.io/httpd
  ```

Example of a successful search:

```sh
podman search httpd --filter=is-official
INDEX       NAME                     DESCRIPTION                     STARS       OFFICIAL    AUTOMATED
docker.io   docker.io/library/httpd  The Apache HTTP Server Project  4709        [OK]
```

---

## Using Docker

Docker is another popular container engine that you might use during your training. Here are some basic Docker commands:

### Searching for Images

To search for images on Docker Hub:

```sh
docker search nginx
```

### Pulling Images

To pull an image from Docker Hub:

```sh
docker pull nginx
```

### Running Containers

To run a container from the pulled image:

```sh
docker run -d -p 8080:80 nginx
```

### Managing Containers

- **List running containers**:

  ```sh
  docker ps
  ```

- **List all containers**:

  ```sh
  docker ps -a
  ```

- **Start a stopped container**:

  ```sh
  docker start <container_id_or_name>
  ```

- **Stop a running container**:

  ```sh
  docker stop <container_id_or_name>
  ```

- **Inspect a container**:

  ```sh
  docker inspect <container_id_or_name>
  ```
